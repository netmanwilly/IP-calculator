# IP-calculator
# the goal is to create a program that will calculate the network address, usable IP ranges, and broadcast address based on a given IP address and subnet mask
# the program converts the string into different parts which get converted to binary to calculate the network address based on the subnet mask
# the program then converts everything back to binary
# still need to add functions to calculate the range of IP address and broadcast address
