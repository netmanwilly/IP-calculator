# IP-calculator
# Code used to calculate Network Address, First Usable, Last Usable, and Broadcast Address
# There is a lot that could've been changed to make it more efficient but this was my first time turning my idea into a working project
# There is almost no input validation but that wouldn't be too hard to implement
# The main function uses one function which uses another function and so on
# Im not sure if thats the best idea when designing code but it was a learning experience nonetheless
